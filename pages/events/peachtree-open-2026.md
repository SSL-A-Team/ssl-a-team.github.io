### Tournament Details

We will be playing standard Division B SSL rules.

Vision will be provided by the new [vision processor](https://github.com/TIGERs-Mannheim/vision-processor).

The field surface will be built using [carpet-covered foam tiles](https://www.wesellmats.com/products/10mm-thick-carpet-top-mats?variant=41651261636815). These tend to have higher traction than the usual field surface at the international RoboCup events.
